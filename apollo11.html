    	<h1>Summary of the Apollo 11 mission</h1>
     	<div>
			<p>Apollo 11 was a very important flight in the history of the world. It was the first craft that sent men onto the moon. For decades, the United States and the Soviet Union were fighting to send humans in space.</p>
			<p>The Soviet Union sent two satellites into space, Sputnik 1 and 2. Sputnik 2 had a dog named Laika in it. The US then sent Explorer 1, which was a satellite too, into space. The US on a later mission, sent a chimpanzee named Ham into space (he survived). 
			<p>The Soviet Union then sent Yuri Gagarin into space in a craft named Vostok I. The US responded by sending Alan B. Shepherd into space in the Freedom 7.</p>
			<p>Then the US made a comeback to try to win the space race with the Apollo missions. Apollo missions 1 through 10 were unsuccessful, but Apollo 11 sent men to the moon.</p>
			<p>Neil Armstrong is very well known for being the first man on the moon. He was the Spacecraft Commander of the mission. His job was to command. Edwin (Buzz) Aldrin was the second man on the moon. He was the Lunar Module Pilot of the mission. His job was to pilot the Eagle, the landing craft. Michael Collins isn't as well known because he didn’t get to actually be on the moon. He was the Command Module Pilot of the mission. His job was to pilot the Columbia, the craft that stayed in space.<p/>
			<p>First, Apollo 11 blasted off at Cape Kennedy on July 16, 1969, rocketing the craft into space and starting it’s orbit around earth. 2 hours and 44 minutes later, the engines ignited again putting it in a lunar orbit. On July 20, the Eagle detached from the Columbia and began it’s descent to the surface with Armstrong and Aldrin in it. Collins stayed in the Columbia to pilot it.</p>
			<p>It landed perfectly. 3 hours after landing, Armstrong stepped down the ladder and said his famous words: “One small step for man, one giant step for mankind.”. About 20 minutes later, Aldrin came down and said “Beautiful View!”. They spent 21 hours and 36 minutes on the moon. They left a flag and a plague on the surface. They lifted off, docked with the Colombia, and went home .</p>
