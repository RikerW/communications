    	<h1>Summary of Genghis Khan and his Hawk</h1>
      <div>
		<p>"Genghis Khan and his Hawk" is based on an old folktale that may have originated in Mongolia. The characters are guess who, Genghis khan and his hawk! It is placed probably in a forest in Mongolia. The folktale is the following.</p>
		<p>One day while on a hunt, Genghis Khan loses the deer he was hunting and then looks for a stream to nourish himself. He finds a stream and takes his cup from his pack, fills it, and then brings it to his lips. Before he can take a sip, his hawk swoops down and knocks his cup from his hand.</p>
		<p>When Genghis tries it a second time, the same thing happens. The third time Genghis has his sword at the ready and the hawk gets killed. After that the khan’s cup is filling so slowly that he looks for the source of the stream's water.</p>
		<p>He finds it and sees that there is a dead serpent in the water and all of its venom spilled into the water. Genghis is recklessly reckless in his active actions and that has a terrible consequence. The khan’s hawk is considerate and spots the dead serpent in the water and tries to save his master. However, Genghis jumps to conclusions and thinks the hawk is attacking him on purpose.</p>
		<p>When the hawk knocks the cup from his hands a third time, the khan strikes him down. When Genghis looks for the source he sees the dead serpent and realizes that his hawk was trying to save him.</p>
		<p>Genghis Khan and his Hawk symbolizes how rash actions can be wrong and may have massively massive™ consequences. It is like any other story at the beginning, but as it progress on the actions of the hawk is puzzling then tragically revealed.</p>
		<p>So what is the take-home message? Is it “You may not see or completely understand what a friend is trying to do in the present, but you will know and understand in the future” or is it “Do not be quickly provoked in your spirit, for anger resides in the lap of fools” (Ecclesiastes 7:9).</p>
